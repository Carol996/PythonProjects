# PythonProjects
Storage of all Python projects


Assignments folder contains all challenges, homework, and projects turned in. 

Notes folder contains practice code; stored for recordkeeping purposes.

In this repository I have a collection on basic projects I've completed using Python combined with Django and SQLite3. 

The Checkbook and Hotels Projects showcase different models and methods. They each have:

    -A database
    -Static files
    -Were created with a virtual environment.

See files for more information.
